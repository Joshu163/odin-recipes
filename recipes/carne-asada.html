    <p>Authentic Mexican Carne Asada marinated in citrus juices, beer, and spices,
        and then grilled over hot coals for a wonderful charred flavor. 
        This delicious Mexican entree is wonderful with rice and beans and equally amazing in burritos, 
        tacos, quesadillas, and nachos.</p>
